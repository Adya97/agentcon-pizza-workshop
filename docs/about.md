# About This Workshop  

This workshop is part of the **[Global AI Community](https://www.globalai.community)** initiative.  
Our mission is to connect AI enthusiasts, developers, and professionals worldwide through accessible learning resources, hands-on workshops, and community events.  

The **Azure AI Foundry Workshop** was created to help participants:  
- Get hands-on experience with Azure AI Foundry  
- Learn how to build intelligent agents step by step  
- Understand practical use cases for system prompts, RAG, tool calling, and MCP  
- Collaborate and share knowledge in an open community setting  

We believe in **learning by doing**—that’s why this session is designed as a guided, practical workshop where you’ll leave with a working AI agent you can build upon.
