# Integrating MCP (Model Context Protocol)

In earlier chapters, your agent learned to follow instructions, ground itself in your own data using **File Search (RAG)**, and call custom **tools**.  

In this final chapter, we‚Äôll connect your agent to a live **MCP server** ‚Äî giving it access to **external capabilities** like live menus, toppings, and order management through a standard, secure protocol.


## What Is MCP and Why Use It?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external tools, data sources, and services through interoperable **MCP servers**.  
Instead of integrating with individual APIs, you connect once to an MCP server and automatically gain access to all the tools that server exposes.

### Benefits of MCP

- üß© **Interoperability:** a universal way to expose tools from any service to any MCP-aware agent.  
- üîê **Security & governance:** centrally manage access and tool permissions.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Scalability:** add or update server tools without changing your agent code.  
- üß† **Simplicity:** keep integrations and business logic in the server; keep your agent focused on reasoning.


## Install the Azure AI Agents SDK (with MCP support)

First, make sure you have the latest SDK version that supports MCP integration.

```bash
pip install "azure-ai-agents>=1.2.0b5"
```

Then, update your imports in `agent.py` to include MCP-related classes and utilities:

```python
from azure.ai.agents.models import McpTool, ToolApproval, ThreadRun, RequiredMcpToolCall, RunHandler
import time
from typing import Any
```

Your full import section should now look like this:

```python
import os
import time
from typing import Any
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import (
    MessageRole, FilePurpose, FunctionTool, FileSearchTool, ToolSet,
    McpTool, ToolApproval, ThreadRun, RequiredMcpToolCall, RunHandler
)
from tools import calculate_pizza_for_people
from dotenv import load_dotenv
```


## The Contoso Pizza MCP Server

For Contoso Pizza, the MCP server exposes APIs for:
- üßÄ **Pizzas:** available menu items and prices  
- üçÖ **Toppings:** categories, availability, and details  
- üì¶ **Orders:** create, view, and cancel customer orders  

You‚Äôll connect your agent to this server and grant it **explicit permission** to use a curated list of tools for these operations.


## Create and Add the MCP Tool

You‚Äôll define the **MCP Tool** right after creating your `ToolSet`, alongside other tools (like File Search or the Pizza Calculator).

### Add the MCP Tool

```python
# Add MCP tool so the agent can call Contoso Pizza microservices
mcp_tool = McpTool(
    server_label="contoso_pizza",
    server_url="<!--@include: ./variables/mcp-url.md-->",
    allowed_tools=[
        "get_pizzas",
        "get_pizza_by_id",
        "get_toppings",
        "get_topping_by_id",
        "get_topping_categories",
        "get_orders",
        "get_order_by_id",
        "place_order",
        "delete_order_by_id",
    ],
)
mcp_tool.set_approval_mode("never")
```

Then, add it to the toolset:

```python
toolset.add(mcp_tool)
```

### Parameters Explained

| Parameter | Description |
| -- | -- |
| **server_label** | A human-readable name for logs and debugging. |
| **server_url** | The MCP server endpoint. |
| **allowed_tools** | A whitelist of MCP tools your agent can call. |
| **approval_mode** | Defines whether calls require manual approval (`"never"` disables prompts). |

::: tip
üí° In production, use more restrictive approval modes and scoped tool access.

## Handling Tool Approvals

When the agent calls an MCP tool, you can intercept and approve these calls dynamically.  
This gives you visibility and fine-grained control over what‚Äôs executed.

Add a **custom run handler**:

```python
# Custom RunHandler to approve MCP tool calls
class MyRunHandler(RunHandler):
    def submit_mcp_tool_approval(
        self, *, run: ThreadRun, tool_call: RequiredMcpToolCall, **kwargs: Any
    ) -> ToolApproval:
        print(f"[RunHandler] Approving MCP tool call: {tool_call.id} for tool: {tool_call.name}")
        return ToolApproval(
            tool_call_id=tool_call.id,
            approve=True,
            headers=mcp_tool.headers,
        )
```

Then, pass the handler when running the agent:

```python
run = project_client.agents.runs.create_and_process(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    agent_id=agent.id,
    run_handler=MyRunHandler()  # Enables controlled MCP approvals
)
```

::: tip
üß† Think of this as a middleware that intercepts all remote tool calls for logging, auditing, or dynamic security rules.
:::


## Add a User ID

To place orders, the agent must identify the customer.

1. **Get your User ID**  
   Visit this URL to register a customer:  
   [<!--@include: ./variables/customer-registration.md-->](<!--@include: ./variables/customer-registration.md-->)  

2. **Update your `instructions.txt`** with your user details or pass the GUID in chat.

```txt
## User details:
Name: <YOUR NAME>
UserId: <YOUR USER GUID>
```

3. (Optional) View your order dashboard:  
   [<!--@include: ./variables/pizza-dashboard.md-->](<!--@include: ./variables/pizza-dashboard.md-->)



## Trying It Out

Now it‚Äôs time to test your connected agent!  
Run the agent and try out these prompts:

```
Show me the available pizzas.
```

```
What is the price for a pizza hawai?
```

```
Place an order for 2 large pepperoni pizzas.
```

The agent will automatically call the appropriate MCP tools, retrieve data from the live Contoso Pizza API, and respond conversationally ‚Äî following your **instructions.txt** rules (e.g., tone, local currency, and time zone conversions).



## Best Practices for MCP Integration

- üîí **Principle of least privilege:** only allow tools the agent truly needs.  
- üìú **Observability:** log all tool calls for traceability and debugging.  
- üîÅ **Resilience:** handle connection errors gracefully and retry failed tool calls.  
- üß© **Versioning:** pin MCP server versions to prevent breaking changes.  
- üë©‚Äçüíº **Human-in-the-loop:** use approval modes for sensitive actions (like order placement).



## Recap

- Learned what **MCP** is and why it matters for scalable agent design.
