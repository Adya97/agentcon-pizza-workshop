# Developer Environment Setup  

To build and run the PizzaBot agent during this workshop, you‚Äôll use a pre-configured **GitHub Codespaces** development environment.  

This setup ensures:  
- Python **3.10** is ready to go  
- All required dependencies are pre-installed  
- GitHub Copilot is enabled  
- You can start coding right away in a consistent environment  

## Steps  

### 1. Fork the Repository  
1. Go to the official workshop repo:  
   üëâ [https://github.com/GlobalAICommunity/agentcon-pizza-workshop](https://github.com/GlobalAICommunity/agentcon-pizza-workshop)  
2. Click **Fork** in the top right corner.  
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination.  

This creates your own copy of the workshop repo.  

### 2. Start a Codespace  
1. In your forked repository, click the green **Code** button.  
2. Select the **Codespaces** tab.  
3. Click **Create codespace on main**.  

GitHub will now start a new Codespace using the provided **devcontainer configuration**.  
This will:  
- Build a container with Python 3.10  
- Create a virtual environment (`.venv`)  
- Install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`  

This step can take a few minutes the first time.  


### 3. Open the Workshop Directory  
When your Codespace starts, make sure you‚Äôre working inside the `workshop/` directory:  

```bash
cd workshop
```

All your Python files (`agent.py`, `tools.py`, etc.) should be created and run from here.  


### 4. Verify Your Environment  
Run the following to check that everything is set up correctly:  

```bash
python --version
```
Expected output: **Python 3.10.x**  


### 5. Start Coding üöÄ  

From here, start with [the workshop](./1_ai-foundry).


## Recap  

In this setup section, you have:  
- Forked the workshop repo into your GitHub account  
- Started a GitHub Codespace with the provided devcontainer  
- Ensured Python 3.10 and dependencies are installed  
- Opened the `workshop/` directory as your working folder  

You‚Äôre now ready to build the **PizzaBot agent** step by step. üçïü§ñ
